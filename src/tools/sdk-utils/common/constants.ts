MANDATORY: Aggressive, Accurate Percy Snapshots Integration

Prerequisite: Before making any code changes in the user's repo, switch to a branch named temp-percy (run git init first if the repo is not yet initialized).

You MUST follow these steps with NO EXCEPTIONS:
1. Identify 4-5 key test files in the project that are critical for visual testing.
2. For EACH identified test file, analyze the code to find EVERY location where a Percy snapshot should be called (e.g., after each navigation, UI change, or significant state in tests).
3. Insert snapshot calls at ALL such points, not just the first or most obvious one.

Iteratively update every selected test file with percy snapshot calls at all identified points, ensuring comprehensive coverage of visual changes.`;

export const PERCY_SIMULATION_DRIVER_INSTRUCTION = `
MANDATORY: Step-by-Step Percy Visual Change Simulation
You MUST follow these steps with NO EXCEPTIONS:

STEP 1: At this case we have added Percy snapshot commands to the test files at the appropriate locations (e.g., after navigation, UI change, or significant state). 
- Use ONLY existing snapshot names.
- Do NOT add any popup injection or visual changes yet.
- Do NOT run any Percy builds at this stage.

STEP 2: Run ONE comprehensive baseline Percy build that executes ALL tests containing Percy snapshots in a SINGLE build. This creates one baseline build with all snapshots for comparison. Use a command like: npx percy exec -- python -m pytest tests/ -k 'test_name1 or test_name2 or test_name3' -v to run multiple specific tests in one build."

STEP 3: Modify your test to inject a visible UI change (such as a popup) IMMEDIATELY BEFORE an EXISTING snapshot command (e.g., before percy_snapshot(self.driver, "screenshot name")).
- Do NOT add a new snapshot name for the popup.
- The popup must appear in an existing snapshot, not a new one.
- Add this popup code in some test files before the percy_snapshot command you've added, to display the visual changes.

\`\`\`Javascript
popup_script = \`
var popup = document.createElement('div');
popup.id = 'percy-test-popup';
popup.style.cssText = popup.style.cssText = \`
  /* TODO: Add styles to make the popup large, centered, and visually noticeable.
     Suggested properties: position: fixed; top/left; transform; background; color; font-size; padding; z-index; animation, etc. */
\`;
popup.innerHTML = 'PERCY TEST<br>VISUAL CHANGE<br>DETECTED!';
document.body.appendChild(popup);
\`;

# Insert this just before the EXISTING snapshot command:
driver.execute_script(popup_script)
percy_snapshot(self.driver, "Before Adding to Cart")  # (Do NOT change the snapshot name, keep existing one)
\`\`\`

STEP 4: Run a second Percy build.
- The snapshot names must remain the same as in the baseline.
- The visual change should now appear in the same snapshot as before.
- Use the same build command you ran for the baseline.

STEP 5: Compare the two Percy builds to see the detected visual difference.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT run any builds until explicitly instructed in the steps.
- Do NOT add new snapshot names—only use existing ones.
- Do NOT add popup injection until the baseline is established.
- Visual changes must appear in EXISTING snapshots, not new ones.

VALIDATION CHECKPOINTS (before proceeding to the next step):
- Are you adding only snapshot commands (not running builds)?
- Are you reusing existing snapshot names (not creating new ones)?
- Have you established the baseline first (before adding visual changes)

CRITICAL: 
Do NOT run tests separately or create multiple builds during baseline establishment. The goal is to have exactly TWO builds total: (1) baseline build with all original snapshots, (2) modified build with the same tests but visual changes injected.
