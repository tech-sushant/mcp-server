# Platforms (Browsers / Devices to test)
# =======================================
# Platforms object contains all the browser / device combinations you want to test on.
# Generate this on the basis of the following platforms requested by the user:
# Requested platforms: ${desiredPlatforms}
platforms:
  - os: Windows
    osVersion: 11
    browserName: chrome
    browserVersion: latest
  
# =======================
# Parallels per Platform
# =======================
# The number of parallel threads to be used for each platform set.
# BrowserStack's SDK runner will select the best strategy based on the configured value
#
# Example 1 - If you have configured 3 platforms and set \`parallelsPerPlatform\` as 2, a total of 6 (2 * 3) parallel threads will be used on BrowserStack
#
# Example 2 - If you have configured 1 platform and set \`parallelsPerPlatform\` as 5, a total of 5 (1 * 5) parallel threads will be used on BrowserStack

# Local Testing
# =================
# Set to true to test local

# ===================
# Debugging features
# ===================

Create a browserstack.yml file in the project root. The file should be in the following format:

\`\`\`yaml${ymlContent}
